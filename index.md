# Projects

*Some links in this section may not lead anywhere yet. I am regularly uploading old projects listed here to my github account.*


## Professional

* **6 month internship in engineering** : Integration of a benchmarking tool on [Cosmotech](https://cosmotech.com/)'s complex system modelling and simulation software. C++ development with strong optimisation constraints on core mechanism of the software.
