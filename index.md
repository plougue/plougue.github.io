### **6 month research internship**  (Compiègne, France)
Research internship within <a href='https://www.hds.utc.fr/'>Heudisayc Laboratory</a> 
(<img src="images/Logos/cnrs.svg" width="3.4%" /> CNRS / <img src="images/Logos/utc.svg" width="3.4%" /> UTC)
under the supervision of <a href='https://www.hds.utc.fr/~sdesterc/dokuwiki/'>Sebastien Destercke</a>.
Study of single-user **preference elicitation** methods in the context of multi-criteria decision making (**MCDA**).
Two field of research : **decision theory** and **uncertainty management**. 
Result: a method for eliciting preferences with uncertain answers and
some of its theoretical / practical properties.

## Machine learning class projects

* __Image detection project__ (2018): Train two machine learning algorithms to detect faces and bodies using 
  the corresponding data sets.
  The detection was made using a sliding window technique and classification through **histograms of gradients**
  and **svm**.  
  In order to prevent a potentially large number of false positives the training was done twice: first with a
  classification training set, and then with the same training set in addition to false positives encoutered in our
  detection test sets.
* [__Classification project__](https://github.com/plougue/Classification-project-2018) (2018) : Analysis of the results of previously studied classification methods (**lda, qda, naïve bayes, log regression, decision trees, ...**) on several binary data sets.
Discussion about why each method did or did not work according to charasteristics of the data sets such as sample size, number of features, overall shape of the data or any other tool of unsupervised analysis. 
Study of an **adaptation of dicriminant analysis for binary variables**, proof of the solution to the optimisation problem for finding the parameter of maximum likelihood. Application of this method to concrete data sets. Interpretation of the results when compared to other discriminant analysis methods.
* __Unsupervised analysis project__ (2018) : Use clustering and unsupervised analysis methods described below to analyse a real-life data set. Theoretical study of an **adaptation of K-means clustering in which the distance to the center depends on the covariance matrix** of each class. Implementation of this adapted K-means method on a concrete case. Application of this method to concrete data sets. Proof of the solution to the optimisation problem corresponding to this new way of computing distance to the center.
* **Machine learning practical work** (2018) : Theoretically oriented experiments in R of machine learning concepts : in-depth exploration of **pca** (computing by hand the values relevant to pca such as the inertia of a cloud of points),  **MDS, Hierarchical cluster analysis, k-means, ...** 
* [Classification project](https://github.com/plougue/Classification-project-2017) (2017) : Build 3 classifiers from 3 real-life data sets to perform as well as possible using classification methods described below
* **Machine learning practical work** (2017) : Theoretical and practical training with classification and regression methods : **kNN, linear regression, model selection, splines, GAM, EM algorithm, Gaussian Mixture models, Tree-base methods, Set-based methods, SVM, SVR, kPCA, neural networks, ...**

## Mathematical modelling scripts
*Most of these were made during class projects and practicals using [scilab](https://www.scilab.org/) or matlab*
* **Introduction to mathematical modelling** (2015) : fractal modelisation, differential equations, spectral analysis, svd, optimisation, fourier decomposition
* **Linear programming projects in XPress-MP** (2016) 

## Miscellaneous (academic)

* [Prolog khan game with logic-based symbolic AI](https://github.com/plougue/Prolog-khan) (2016)
* [C++ object oriented calculator](https://github.com/plougue/Cpp-calculator) (2016)
* **SQL and PHP powered dynamic tutorial hosting website** (backend) (2015)

## Miscellaneous (spare time)
* [Python platform game prototype](https://github.com/plougue/O_Platformer) made with pygame (2017) 
* Several small arcade games made in C using SDL (very old)
